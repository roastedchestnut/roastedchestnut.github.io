If you looked in to PHP in the past where there were bunch of PHP4 spaghetti codes mixed with partial templates everywhere, you probably never came back to PHP (and I think that was wise).

However, what Laravel with modern PHP offers might surprise you.

# "Eloquent" ORM
Yeah, many modern web frameworks also support ORM. But still, built-in ORM support for web framework is a nice thing to have. For example, like Flask, coding and configuration for SQLAlchemy integration is another pain in the neck (language!). By the way, this is motto of Laravel.

> Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.

# Dependency Injection
It is hard to call a web framework modern without dependency injection included. Laravel supports dependency injection with type-hinting! With a fact that PHP is known for its chaotic typing, it is definitely a big plus.

# Lightweight
With these "must have" functionalities, it still manages to keep itself simple and lightweight. In other words, it has limited built-in functionalities compared to Heavy web frameworks such as Django or Ruby on Rails. However, it's just point of view. I'll count this as a advantage.
