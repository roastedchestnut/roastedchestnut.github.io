Open source is everywhere. If you're reading this post online, the probability of not-using-open-source is literally zero. Or if you have a smarphone, it's zero, too. 

Since open source established its concept in 1998, it has affected and contributed to every aspect of the software. However, not everybody is happy with philosophy of open source. They even want to change it!

Basically, their point is that big tech companies make profit providing services based on open source projects without contributing much of anything back to the community. To do so, they invetned licenses to replace popular open source licenses such as MIT License, Apache License or GPL(GNU General Public License). 

For example, MongoDB changed its license from AGPL to SSPL. SSPL enforces user to make their entire source code available to the public in case of user selling service based on open source. It prevents big tech companies from strip-mining their project. 

This new concept is called shared source. It protects contributors' rights while it keeps the shared source projects "open". As you might have noticed, open source and shared source is not completely different thing. They share most of the philosophy. Shared source just provides some protection to the contributors. However, technically, shared source is not considered as open source.

Who knows? Just like open source replaced free software, shared source might take over open source someday.
